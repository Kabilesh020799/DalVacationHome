GCP CloudRun:
It is used to build applications or websites quickly on a fully managed platform [1].
Builds can be automated whenever code is committed and deployed on a specific branch.
It automatically scales containers up and down; it follows the pay only when your code is running model.
In this business case, Cloud Run services can receive messages from Pub/Sub push subscriptions.
It can be used to host the front end of the web application [2].
It can easily interact with services from AWS using API gateways and integrate with GCP services using SDK [3].
Cost: For cpu usage: $0.00001800 / vCPU-second. For memory usage: $0.00000200 / GiB-second.

GCP Cloud Deployment manager:
You can use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to create a set of Google Cloud resources and manage them as a unit, called a deployment [4].
Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Google Cloud services,
such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL, configured to work together.
For the given business case, it can used as IaC(Infrastructure as Code) [5] to provision and deploy resouces on Google Cloud Platform [6]. 
Cost: Custom to the resources provisioned and used.

GCP LookerStudio dashboard:
It allows simple drag-and-drop objects with fully custom property panels in the canvas for visualization of data [7]. 
It has pre-designed templates and allows you to connect to different data sources. 
Each data source has a prebuilt connector to ensure the data is easy to access.
In this business case, it can be used to visualize the login statistics in the front-end application. 
The case-study for the e-commerce implementation, will be a guidance in the implementation process [8]. 
Cost: Charged for analysis amount of view even if only viewing it [9].

GCP Google Natural Language API:
It is pre-trained model that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features like sentiment analysis, entity analysis, entity 
sentiment analysis, content classification, and syntax analysis [10]. In this business case, the customer’s feedback is analyzed 
to understand the sentiment and presented to all users. Using the score and magnitude, it can be categorized into positive, negative, 
and neutral [11]. Cost: For sentiment analysis, per 1,000-character unit, $0.0020 per request for requests in the range of 5K-1M [12].
